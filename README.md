# _東方Project_ Fonts File Archive
A file archive for an ongoing project cataloguing every font used in CD jewel case sleeves across the _東方Project_ franchise. 

The list of titles catalogued in this project are:

- **Mainline series games** (1st–18th as of writing)
- **Danmaku spinoff games** (9.5th–18.5th as of writing)
- **黄昏フロンティア-developed spinoff games** (7.5th–17.5th as of writing)
- **Soundtrack albums for 黄昏フロンティア-developed spinoff games** (7.5th–17.5th as of writing)
- **Ongoing concept album series _“ZUN's Music Collection”_** (vols. 1–9.5 as of writing)
- **Remastered soundtrack albums for PC–98-platform mainline games _“Akyu's Untouched Score”_** (vols. 1–5)

Anything outside of this list—such as spinoff literature, bonus enclosure CDs, related series like the _西方Project_, _トルテルマジック_, etc.—is not planned to be included.

This project is a work in progress; as such, files in this repository are subject to change often.

For legal reasons, the font files themselves are not included in this archive.
